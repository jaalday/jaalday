Hey there! I'm Jaclyn, a fresh-faced software developer with a love of cats and painting. 
Before diving into the world of coding, I spent years as a vet tech, 
caring for furry companions and learning the art of problem-solving.

When I'm not coding, you can find me painting or watching movies with my cats.
