Hello! I'm Jaclyn, I am a fresh faced software developer. Before diving into the world of coding, I spent years as a dedicated vet tech, nurturing both animals and my love for science. In my spare time, I indulge my creative side as an artist. Software development integrates my two passions of art and science together to create systems that are robust as well as visually pleasing.
